#Guidelines for contributors:  
1) Don't push to master. Merge to develop, then some time it'll be merged to master.
--) Repeat: NEVER push to master. Not even small hotfixes. Apply the hotfix to develop. Develop is intended to always be in a releasable-to-public state. Test your changes. If it's a huge potentially breaking change, discuss it with Chdata.
2) When making a PR, make sure it's based on the develop branch, but is renamed as a different branch. (Don't name it master/develop!)

###More will be added later on.
