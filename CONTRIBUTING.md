#Guidelines for contributors:  
1) Don't push to master. Merge to develop, then some time it'll be merged to master.
--) Repeat: NEVER push to master. Not even small hotfixes. Apply the hotfix to develop. Develop is intended to always be in a releasable-to-public state. Test your changes. If it's a huge potentially breaking change, discuss it with Chdata.
2) When making a PR, make sure it's based on the develop branch, but is renamed as a different branch. (Don't name it master/develop!)
3) Make a descriptive commit name, and explain/summarize ALL changes in the description if the commit name isn't enough to summarize the entire commit.
--) Do not make commit names such as "Oops" (Oops what? You mean you fixed something right?), "Unintentional change?" (Fixed unintentional change), "Should work" (What "Should" work? Everything should.), "???" (???), "Tiny batch of changes" (too bad I didn't describe them in the description at all - "1.7 Syntax changes").

###More will be added later on.
